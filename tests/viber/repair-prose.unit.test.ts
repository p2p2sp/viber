/*
 * repair-prose.unit.test.ts - pins the prose that teaches `task-coder` and
 * `task-reviewer` the repair pass (contract C1, the `repair: <problem>` dispatch line).
 *
 * A repair pass is the task's own coder sent back to fix one named problem: its earlier
 * work is already in the tree, it reads its notes file and the task's review reports
 * first, and a `deferred` path is its own to prove. The reviewer gates the named problem
 * and the task's whole `DoD`, running `Verification` and the test the pass added for a
 * `deferred` path. The files read here are shipped prompts, whose text is the behaviour.
 * Nothing is spawned.
 *
 * Run directly by Node's type stripping:
 *   node --test tests/viber/repair-prose.unit.test.ts
